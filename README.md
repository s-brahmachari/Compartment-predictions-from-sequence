# Compartment predictions from DNA sequence information

Overview
--------
Trainable DNN model using Tensorflow 2.x.x to predict compartment and sub-compartment annotations using DNA sequence data (Histone chip seq tracks or RNA seq tracks). GM12878 data from ENCODE is used for training with subcompartment annotations from Rao et al. 2014.
The trained model then can be used to predict subcompartments in other cell types, e.g., IMR-90, using the corresopnding Histone Chip-seq tracks.
